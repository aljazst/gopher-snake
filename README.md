# Gopher snake

This is a attempt to make a pure Go 2D snake game. It's my first project in go, dedicated to learning the basics of the language.

## How it works

It's like a basic snake game. Use the arrow keys to move around. Press J for a new random position of the Gopher emoji. If you press the Esc key the game will close.

## Documentation

[Pixel 2D game library used](https://github.com/faiface/pixel)

[Pixel example game](https://github.com/faiface/pixel-examples/tree/master/platformer) A lot of the logic is borrowed from this repo.

The Gopher spritesheet and the Gopher emojis (png images loose quality when shrinked, thats why the emojis dont look as good in the game) comes from excellent [Egon Elbre](https://github.com/egonelbre/gophers).

## Features roadmap 

🚧 This project is a work in progress, some features are missing and they will arrive in the future (I guess) (Maybe) (I hope) (Ok, probably not).

- ✅ Gopher dies when touching the border (The gophers position resets to the center)
- ✅ When the goapher touches a gopher emoji it collects it and another emoji appears.
- 🏗 When the emoji is collected it has to reappear behind the gopher and follow him. (will be implemented in the future)
- 🏗 When the gopher touches one of the collected emojis its game over. (will be implemented in the future)
- 💭 A leaderboard
- 💭 A game menu

Legend:
- ✅ Implemented
- 💭 Not yet implemented, still in my mind!
- 🏗 Working on it

## My thougs on Go

I like it. I like it a lot. I mean, I am still a rookie but I am eager to learn the language. But, I don't like game development. Some aspects of it just don't suit me. That's probably why the game will remain unfinished.
